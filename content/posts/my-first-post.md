# Hello World!

This is my first post on my new personal website. Im making this site to share my thoughts about stuff, experiences on technology, programming, and other interests. Maybe this will also serve as a part of my _second brain_. 

## Why a personal website?

Im inspired by many tech developers and scientists who publishing a lot of their brilliant works and ideas on their personal websites or blogs, contributing to the open knowledge pool. I, though not as brilliant as them, want to do the same, at least for myself to keep track of my learning journey and share with others if they find it useful. The contents will be written mostly in English, but I may write in Vietnamese sometimes as well.

And well, writings benefit me a lot in organizing my thoughts, improve my language skills, and solidify my understanding and knowledge. Thanks to the **fear of saying something wrong** in public, I'll have to make it right 🤣.

So, welcome to my personal website! Hope that you, will find something interesting here, and I, will find motivation to keep writing.

### P/s: How I made this site?

It took me a while setting things up, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme and put everything on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 

Some tutorials I followed:
> <cite>[Quick start for making a Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)</cite><br>
> <cite>[Hosting on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/)</cite>
